I
was
walking
down
the
street
when
saw
As
beautiful
bouquet
of
flowers
in
front
the
local
bakery
aroma
wafting
from
them
was
simply
amazing
reached
closer
noticed
sign
on
door
freshly
baked
breads
and
pastries
my
stomach
grumbled
with
anticipation
imagined 
delicious
taste
warm
croissant
Suddenly
gust
wind
blew
flowers
away
scattered
them
across
sidewalk
It
quite
an
arousing
sight
watching
petals
dancing
air
tried
arrange
them
back
bouquet
but
difficult
with
the
wind
blowing
them
every
which
way
As
continued
my
stroll
came
across
street
performer
playing
guitar
his
music
was
so
astonishing
that
couldn't
help
but
stop
and
listen
melody
was
like
magic
transporting
me
to
another
place
entirely
eventually
made
my
way
to
the
local
cafe
where
i
ordered
a
cup
of
coffee
and
sat
down
to
relax
the
ambiance
was
cozy
and
inviting
with
soft
music
playing
in
the
background
i
took
a
sip
of
my
coffee
and
let
out
a
As
contented
sigh
overall
it
delightful
day
filled
with
unexpected
surprises
joyous
moments
